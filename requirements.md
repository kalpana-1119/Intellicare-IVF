# Intellicare IVF – Requirements

## 1. Project Title
Intellicare: AI-Based Personalized Embryo Selection System

## 2. Why We Chose This Problem
Nowadays, many couples are forced to choose IVF due to lifestyle issues, health problems, stress, and delayed parenthood.

But current IVF systems:
- Select embryos mostly based on appearance
- Ignore patient health history fully
- Often require multiple IVF cycles
- Cause emotional and financial stress

We want to improve the existing IVF process to make it more personalized, successful, and emotionally supportive for couples.

## 3. Proposed Solution
Add a new AI layer in IVF that considers:

- Embryo quality
- Patient health condition
- Hormone levels
- Previous IVF history
- Age and medical issues

The system will predict which embryo has the highest success chance for that specific patient.

## 4. Objectives
- Increase IVF success rate
- Reduce repeated IVF cycles
- Reduce emotional stress for couples
- Support doctors with better decisions
- Improve existing IVF systems, not replace them

## 5. Stakeholders
- Patients and couples
- Fertility doctors
- IVF clinics
- Medical researchers

## 6. Functional Requirements
1. Upload embryo images/videos
2. Upload patient medical data
3. Combine embryo + patient data
4. Train ML model
5. Predict best embryo for each patient
6. Show success probability
7. Store IVF outcome data
8. Dashboard for doctors
9. Secure login and data privacy

## 7. Non-Functional Requirements
- High data privacy
- Explainable AI results
- Accurate predictions
- Easy-to-use interface
- Secure medical storage

## 8. Data Requirements
Embryo Data:
- Images/videos
- Morphology score
- Development stage

Patient Data:
- Age, BMI
- Hormone levels
- PCOS/endometriosis history
- Previous IVF attempts

Outcome Data:
- Implantation success
- Pregnancy result

## 9. Constraints
- Medical data privacy laws
- Limited datasets
- Ethical approvals needed

## 10. Success Metrics
- Higher IVF success rate
- Fewer repeated IVF cycles
- Positive doctor feedback
- Better patient emotional outcomes
